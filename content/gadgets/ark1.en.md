**ARC-01** is an interstellar spacecraft built with advanced human technology, the result of engineering that merges relativistic physics, quantum systems, and emerging post-quantum principles. Its main structure is organized around a reinforced longitudinal spine made of self-repairing metamaterials, designed to withstand extreme stresses during hyperspace transit.

Large rotating ring modules generate artificial gravity through controlled acceleration, providing stable, Earth-like living conditions without reliance on external gravitational fields. At the core of the vessel, a hyperspace drive manipulates the geometry of space-time, opening transit corridors through coherent quantum states and resonance-based energy control that surpasses classical entanglement.

The ship is managed by a distributed intelligence architecture rather than a single central AI, allowing simultaneous multi-state processing for navigation, energy regulation, and structural integrity. Luminous energy channels flow across the hull, visually mapping power circulation in real time. ARC-01 is not merely a vehicle—it is a self-sustaining platform for exploration, research, and human expansion where known physical laws begin to transform.
