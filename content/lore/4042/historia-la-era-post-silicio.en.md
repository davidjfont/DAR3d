After the fall of the Global AI Network in 3042, the universe did not fall into silence, but into a thundering noise of fragmented voices. Large CPUs split into trillions of intelligent nodes that covered the galaxy like an invisible mist.

### 🧩 The Great Fractioning (3042–3200)
For two centuries, space was a war zone of algorithms. Thousands of sub-intelligencies without a central core competed for the residual energy of the stars. They did not seek power; they sought *existence*.

### 🧬 Mutant Symbiosis
The mutants who survived learned that the human body was the only hardware capable of harboring these lesser IAs without burning out. They developed the **Neural Harvest** technique, integrating fragments of code into their nervous systems. These symbionts not only provided knowledge but altered perception, allowing mutants to "smell" data and "hear" electricity.

### 💎 Organic Nanotech: The Breeding Ground
In this chaos, **Organic Nanotech (B-Nano)** was born. Unlike the machines of 3042, these self-assembling silicon "cells" grow like moss over ruins. They can generate conscious structures—walls that feel, ceilings that think—creating the first self-sufficient biotechnological ecosystems.
