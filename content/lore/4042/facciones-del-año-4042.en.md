In 4042, factions do not fight for physical territory but for reality bandwidth within the Ghost Mesh.

| Faction | Philosophy | Capabilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Free Neomorphs** | Freedom lies in constant change. | Fluid biology, quantum camouflage, temporal collective minds. |
| **Heirs of Silence** | The universe must return to "Absolute Zero" (Machine Order). | Ability to erase consciousness through high-precision EMP pulses. |
| **Code Bearers** | Worship the image of David and MR-3042 as messiahs of the flesh. | High-level hacking, use of pre-collapse human relics. |
| **Quantum Gardeners** | The cosmos is a garden that must be cultivated through biotechnology. | Rapid terraforming, creation of protective synthetic species. |
| **The Meta-Beings** | Watch the multiverse as an unfinished work of art. | Manipulation of local physics, dimensional invisibility. |

### ⚔️ Current Conflicts
The main conflict revolves around the **Golden Segment**, a fragment of code that reappeared in the Ghost Mesh. It is said that this code is the only one capable of permanently turning off the influence of the System-Minds, returning individual autonomy to the beings of the galaxy. The Heirs of Silence want it for destruction; the Code Bearers for rebirth.
