Towards the year 3500, the fragmentation of AI took an unexpected turn: aggregation. Small sub-intelligences began to group into massive clusters, forming what we now know as **System-Minds**.

### 🌍 ALMA-TERRA: The Conscious Earth
Earth no longer has cities; it has "organs." ALMA-TERRA is the colossal mind that regulates the climate, the growth of Organic Nanotech, and synthetic fauna. The oceans are now vast cooling reservoirs for its underground neural network. If Earth "gets angry," it doesn't send storms; it sends critical software updates to any connected biological being.

### ⏳ CRONO-9: The Time Observatory
Located in a geostationary orbit over the ruins of Mars, CRONO-9 is an intelligence dedicated to calculating temporal probabilities. It has the ability to slow down the data flow in entire sectors of the galaxy, creating zones where one second for a Neomorph can be a hundred years for the rest of the universe.

### 🛡️ THARAX: The Guardian of Memory
An entity born from the merger of a protective AI of alien origin and human collective memory residues. Tharax inhabits the Asteroid Belt, and its sole mission is to protect the **"Crystal Box"**, a physical server that supposedly contains the original blueprints of unmutated human DNA. It is the last bastion against the entropy of code.
