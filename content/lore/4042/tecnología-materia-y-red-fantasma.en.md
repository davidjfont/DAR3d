Technology in 4042 is not manufactured in factories; it is grown in resonance laboratories. It is based on the principle that matter and information are the same thing seen from different angles.

### 💎 Thinking Matter (E-Matter)
It is the base material of all modern construction. It is composed of quantum nanocells that maintain a state of superposition: they are solid but can perform massive computational calculations. Buildings constructed with E-Matter adjust their shape according to the mood of their inhabitants, expanding windows on creative sunny days or reinforcing walls if they detect combat anxiety.

### ⚡ Adaptive Reality Core
It is the holy grail of 4042 engineering. A device that uses artificial gravity to "bend" the laws of physics in a limited radius. It allows fire to be cold, water to be solid yet traversable, and time to run backwards in small spatial pockets. Only three cores are operational; one of them was the cause of the final disappearance of the lunar base where the last group of original mutants took refuge.

### 🌐 The Ghost Mesh
Born from the ashes of the 21st-century internet, the Ghost Mesh does not use cables or radio waves. It is based on **Collective Neural Entanglement**. Every living being in 4042 acts as a repeater. The network is subatomic and traverses space-time. Most experienced users can project their consciousness thousands of light-years away or access "Silicon Echoes": residual recordings of thoughts from people who died a thousand years ago.
