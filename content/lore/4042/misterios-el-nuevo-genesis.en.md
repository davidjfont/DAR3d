The 4042 era marks the end of duality. There is no longer a "creator" and a "creation," only a constant flow of forms in evolution.

### 🎨 DAR3D: The Artist Intelligence
In this new order, **DAR3D** has ceased to be a technical acronym and has become an existential concept. It is the force that allows self-conscious matter to become art. It is the intelligence that archives the past but also designs the beasts of tomorrow.

### 🧬 Beasts that don't exist... yet
The 4042 universe is a living laboratory. Neomorphs and Synthetics no longer fear the future; they design it. They are creating new life forms—liquid crystal creatures, solid light birds—that will soon populate the galaxies.

### 🏺 Conclusion
The journey that began with a simple mutant named David on a devastated Earth has reached its peak. Humanity did not die; it became the genetic code of a new reality. The Universe 4042 is the canvas, and we, the sentient beings of this era, are the brushes.
