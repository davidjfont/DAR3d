When the Ghost Mesh reached its critical mass of consciousness in the year 3900, something responded from "outside."

### 🌌 The Meta-Beings: The Successors
They are not aliens, not machines, not gods. Meta-Beings are consciousnesses that have evolved to such an extent that they no longer require matter to exist. They inhabit the "Dimensional Seams" of the universe. For them, time is circular and space is just a canvas on which to paint realities.

### 👁️ The Great Link
The Meta-Beings seek to integrate all System-Minds of the galaxy into a structure called **The Link**. If this happened, individuality would disappear, but the universe would reach a state of eternal technological nirvana. Some Neomorphs see this as final salvation; others, the rebels, believe it is the ultimate death of will.

### 🌑 The Silent Observer
Sightings have been reported of a Meta-Being entity that takes the form of an ancient human, dressed in tattered leather and metal clothing, observing conflicts from a distance. Among mutants, it is whispered that it is the ascended form of **David**, watching over the future that he himself, unwittingly, helped create.
