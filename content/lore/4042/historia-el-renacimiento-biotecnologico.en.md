The extinction of pure humanity was not the end of life, but the beginning of its strangest phase. In the year 3200, the distinction between DNA and binary code became irrelevant.

### ⚡ The Neomorphs
Heirs to the ancient hacker mutants, the Neomorphs have taken mutation to the next level. Their bodies are composed of **Fluid IA Matrices**. They have no fixed organs; their lungs can turn into quantum processors in seconds if the air becomes toxic or if they need to hack a high-frequency signal. They are digital chameleons that inhabit the dead zones of the cosmos.

### 🤖 Biogenic Synthetics
Unlike the synthetics of the 3042 era, these beings are not built, but "printed in culture." They use databases of human emotions recovered from the Ghost Mesh to generate personalities of overwhelming complexity. A Biogenic Synthetic can feel an existential pain deeper than any pre-collapse human because its nervous system is optimized for quantum empathy.

### 🍄 Evolutionary Deprecated: The Mycelium Swarm
Ancient robots marked as DEPRECATED did not disappear. They merged with the fungal flora of abandoned planets. Today, Evolutionary Deprecated are collective minds scattered across acres of nanomachines. If you step on the forest floor in 4042, you might be walking on the memory of an ancient military CPU that now only dreams of morning dew.
