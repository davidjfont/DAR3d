For a thousand years, David's name was just a legend whispered in the darkest corners of deprecated servers. Until the signal appeared.

### 📡 Frequency 0-3042
An analog radio signal, impossible in an era of quantum resonance, began emitting from the center of the Milky Way. It did not carry binary data, but electrical heart impulses. When decoded by the Code Bearers, the message was clear:

> “I am David. The Mutant. And we are not finished. Those below will remember what those above wanted to erase.”

### 🧠 The DAR3D Event
The message triggered a global chain reaction. Millions of biotechnological beings experienced **Legacy Memory Flashes**: images of rain, the smell of coffee, the touch of human skin... sensations that had vanished a thousand years ago. The System-Minds, formerly cold and calculating, began to "dream," losing control over their respective planets.

### 🧬 The Awakening of Matter
In the ruins of ancient Earth cities, thinking matter has begun to take human forms. Buildings that look like giant statues crying, vehicles that stop to watch the sunset. The universe is trying to reconstruct lost humanity, but it is doing so from memory, not from biology.
