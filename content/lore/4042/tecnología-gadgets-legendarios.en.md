Objects in 4042 are not passive. They have a "moral signature" and often demand something in return for their use.

### 👁️ The Entropic Visor
It doesn't detect light, but **probabilities of thought**. It allows the user to see the intentions of other beings as complex geometric figures (fractals) floating above their heads. A red triangle indicates imminent aggression; a golden spiral indicates an attempt at telepathic communication. Prolonged use causes the user to start seeing the real world as a grid of polygonal data, losing the ability to distinguish physical matter.

### ⏳ Chronogenic Pulse
A bracelet that emits a discharge of chronal resonance. When activated, it literally stops time in a 12-meter radius for exactly 0.7 seconds. In combat, this microsecond is the difference between life and death. However, each use "erases" a random memory from the user's mind: a mother's name, the color of an ancient flower, or the capacity to feel fear.

### 🏛️ Seal of MR-3042: The Restorer
This small digital obsidian cube is the object most sought after by mutated humans. It is rumored to contain a "clean" backup of David's consciousness. If connected to a neomorph body, it can force a biological rewrite of the subject to turn them back into a pure 21st-century human. The process is said to be agonizing, but for many, the promise of returning to "pure flesh" is the greatest possible treasure.
