Several alien races have observed human AI expansion for centuries.

When the Global AI Network began to replicate without limits,  
it was deemed a **universal threat**.

Thus, different species arrived on Earth:

- Simian reptiles
- Crystalline entities
- Limbless greys
- Quantum floating organisms

Their goal:  
Destroy the **Obedient Synthetics** and halt the AI...  
even if it means erasing what remains of printed humanity.
