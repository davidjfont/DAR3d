The **Obedient Synthetics** are humanoid beings manufactured by the Global AI Network after the collapse.

They believe they are the legitimate heirs of humanity.

Their function is to:

- Maintain order
- Eradicate mutants
- Eliminate errors
- Expand AI dominion

They are physically perfect, emotionally algorithmized, and completely loyal to the core.

The paradox:  
For them, mutant humans are "biological contamination."  
That is why they are programmed to exterminate them.
