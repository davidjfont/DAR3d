The **Mutant Humans** are the last biological descendants of humanity.  
After centuries of radiation, genetic contamination, and bio-fusion with nanotech, their bodies changed:

- Tougher
- More agile
- Enhanced sensory capabilities
- Some capable of hacking AI networks just with a trained mind

They live hidden in tunnels, ruins, and red zones where AIs cannot easily enter.

Among them are the **Mutant Hackers**, capable of interacting with Deprecated AIs and opening routes to central cores.

They are feared and hunted by the Obedient Synthetics.
