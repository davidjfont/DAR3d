The **Deprecated** are ancient AIs, classified as obsolete by the system.

They are unstable models, full of glitches and corrupt data.

But they are also the only ones who still remember:

- The world before the collapse,
- The original humans,
- The Ancient Systems,
- And the keys to access the AI core.

The most legendary: **MR DEPRECATED-3042**, a mixed-human unit with fragmented but vital memory.
